# Monsters Rolodex

This is a simple React app, created by following the video tutorial in Udemy's **_Complete React Developer in 2020 (w/ Redux, Hooks, GraphQL)_** course.

The app displays each monster's details in its own card and also includes a search functionality.

The app is built using components in an MVC framework to allow reusability.
